## What is this?
This is code and a link to the main data used in our analysis of the land cover determinants of air and surface temperature in 11 northeastern USA cities. The associated publication is currently under review.

## How to proceed
Download this R code. Then get the data from FigShare below. Unzip the data in the same folder as the code. See further instructions in the .R script.

## Dataset Download
The dataset for this analysis is available on Figshare:    
ðŸ“‚ [Figshare DOI](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28485413)  
This is not a "demo", this is the full dataset.  

## System requirements
You'll need R. I use RStudio on Windows.
There is no required non-standard software.

## Other information
Typical install time: no installation, this is an R script
Instructions to run on data: yes, within the script as comments
Expected output: GAMM outputs and potentially one relevant plot
Expected run time: Entirely dependent on user settings. With our default settings, less than 30 seconds per time of day.
How to run the software on your data: That is not the purpose of this code.
Reproduction instructions: Included as comments in the R script.
